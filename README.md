VATSTAR Discord Bot
This project is now dead.  
The original scope was to provide a Discord bot for the VATSTAR discord server  
The bot would authenticate users with the VATSIM api and assign them roles based on their ratings.
Eventually I wanted to expand the bot to a web based user CP but other projects took priority.
The VATSTAR discord channel has migrated most of the code into a small package for their server and taken over development.
